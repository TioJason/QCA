- if needed, to add a namespace
- implement another algorithm for high number of conditions (>10)
- implement multi-value algorithms (see Berkeley's Espresso or Petr Fiser's BOOM and FC-Min) 
- implement option to handle missing outcome
- implement option for simplifying assumptions
- implement fuzzy-sets (inclusion) algorithms
- search for another algorithm to solve the prime implicants chart; this is the current bottleneck
