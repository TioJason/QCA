Version 0.3
    o Added function getRow() which returnes the combination of levels for
      a specific row number
    o Fixed a minor bug overseen by the changes in version 0.2-6
    o Function createMatrix() now accepts multiple values (not just 0 and 1)
    o qmcc() is now 20 times faster and it can reasonably work with up to 11 conditions
    o completely redesigned function createChart(), which is now internal
    o old function createChart() is now called demoChart()
    

Version 0.2-6
    o QCA doesn't depend on package "cluster" anymore as qmcc() is now based on dist()
      from the standard stats package, instead of daisy()
    

Version 0.2-5

    o Minor documentation fixes
    o Almost completely rewriten prettyTable() and minor changes to truthTable()
    o QCA doesn't depend on package "combinat" anymore, as function combn() is now
      part of the "utils" package (loaded by default)
    o New function sortMatrix() in the internal functions
    o Argument verifications are now part of internal functions
    o New function readTosmana() for reading Tosmana's XML data files
    

Version 0.2-2

    o Completely redesigned function allExpr() - now allExpressions()
      (way faster than the former)
    o Set up the internal functions; qmcc now looks less cluttered
    o New user level function solveChart() - pulled out of the main qmcc()
    

Version 0.2-1

    o Added function createMatrix() which creates the base matrix for the truth table
    

Version 0.2-0

    o Added function factorize() which finds all common factors of literals in a QCA solution
