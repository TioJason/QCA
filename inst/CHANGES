Version 0.4-5
    o New function shortqca(),  many times faster than qmcc() and a _very_ low memory
      consumption; it can work with 16 or even 17 causal conditions. It is only experimental
      but it looks very promising, especially for multi-valued data.
    

Version 0.4-3
    o Fixed a bug in qmcc(), a matrix unintentionally dropped dimensions upon subsetting
    

Version 0.4-2
    o Fixed a bug in qmcc(), the data was not correctly subsetted.
    o Fixed a bug in qmcc(), involving the argument "show.cases"
    o Added argument "use.letters" to function demoChart()
    o Fixed a minor bug in verify.truthTable()
    

Version 0.4-1
    o Added a namespace for the package
    o Completely rewritten version of base3rows(), now much faster
    o Reworked version of createMatrix(), now much faster for the same number of values
      in each condition
    o Added option "diffmat" to the main qmcc() function; users can choose to generate
      the differences matrix or not: speed or low memory consumption.
    

Version 0.4-0
    o Reworked version of qmcc() with a substantially lower memory consumption;
      it can now work with up to 15 conditions in 1GB of RAM
    o New function base3rows()
    o Fixed minor bug in writeSolution()
    

Version 0.3-5
    o Reworked version of qmcc() which does no longer posess the tt argument
      It is faster, working reasonably with up to 13 conditions.
    o Reworked version of truthTable()
    

Version 0.3-1
    o New function rowDominance() to ease the solving of large prime implicants charts
    

Version 0.3-0
    o New function getRow() which returnes the combination of levels for
      a specific row number
    o Fixed a minor bug overseen by the changes in version 0.2-6
    o Function createMatrix() now accepts multiple values (not just 0 and 1)
    o qmcc() is now 20 times faster and it can reasonably work with up to 11 conditions
    o completely redesigned function createChart(), which is now internal
    o old function createChart() is now called demoChart()
    

Version 0.2-6
    o QCA doesn't depend on package "cluster" anymore as qmcc() is now based on dist()
      from the standard stats package, instead of daisy()
    

Version 0.2-5

    o Minor documentation fixes
    o Almost completely rewriten prettyTable() and minor changes to truthTable()
    o QCA doesn't depend on package "combinat" anymore, as function combn() is now
      part of the "utils" package (loaded by default)
    o New function sortMatrix() in the internal functions
    o Argument verifications are now part of internal functions
    o New function readTosmana() for reading Tosmana's XML data files
    

Version 0.2-2

    o Completely redesigned function allExpr() - now allExpressions()
      (way faster than the former)
    o Set up the internal functions; qmcc now looks less cluttered
    o New user level function solveChart() - pulled out of the main qmcc()
    

Version 0.2-1

    o New function createMatrix() which creates the base matrix for the truth table
    o New function base3rows()
    o Fixed minor bug in writeSolution()
    

Version 0.2-0

    o New function factorize() which finds all common factors of literals in a QCA solution
