    o New toy dataset "MV" to test multi-valued data

Version 0.5-4
    o Eliminated the error message if there is only one causal combination to
      explain, it seems this is more informative than a logically equivalent
      error message (thanks to Burt Monroe for pointing that)

    o Fixed a minor bug in truthTable(), now it correctly arranges the columns
      corresponding to the outcome values

    o New experimental function shortqca(),  many times faster than qmcc() for a
      large of causal conditions (over 11), with a _very_ low memory consumption;
      it can easily work with 16 or 17 causal conditions. It is only experimental
      but it looks very promising, especially for multi-valued data.
