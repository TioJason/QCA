Description: An extensive set of functions to perform Qualitative Comparative Analysis:
             crisp sets (csQCA), temporal (tQCA), multi-value (mvQCA) and fuzzy sets (fsQCA).
             QCA is a methodology that bridges the qualitative and quantitative divide
             in social science research. It uses a boolean algorithm that results in a minimal
             causal combination which explains a given phenomenon.
